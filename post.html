		<h3>Web Scraper</h3>

		<p>This project I started back in November 2020, when I just completed my python bootcamp course.
		<br>
		<br>
		I've created this project in python using libraries like Requests and Beautifulsoup, to keep track on couple of choices of product and it's prices. I've programmed it to send automated mails to myself when the price of  the selected products gets low.
		<br>
		<br>
		 It has been a long time now, since I started learning about programming languages and technologies.
		<br>
		<br>
		While this year (2020) has been really a tough year for all of us, But the good thing happened to me this year is that, it gave me plenty of time to find my true passion that is The World of Computer's and Technology.To setup my goals, to think wisely and choose right path for the future and career i always dreamt to have. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Looking forward I'm trying build a good connection with the people working professionally & studying related to field of computers & technologies, to gain as much as knowledge from them to improve my self.</p>
